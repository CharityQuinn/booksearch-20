# booksearch-20

In this app the user can skim through book titles, read a synopsis of the book.  The user may also enter a book title to do a search and receive data.  

The languages used in the app include React, Express, Logger, MongoDB, and JSX.  The assistance from my instructor and the TAs was immeasurable in completing this task.

Links to sample this app are:

[Book Search, Resized]("./client/public/images/BookSearchNewSize.gif")
